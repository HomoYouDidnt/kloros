# Archived Improvement Proposals

This directory contains historical improvement proposals that were generated
before deduplication was implemented (Oct 20-26, 2025).

## Statistics
- Total proposals archived: 15,126
- Unique issues: 6
- Most common: "bugfix.core failures" (7,381 occurrences, 48.8%)
- Storage: 7.5 MB

## Why archived?
Prior to deduplication, PHASE would generate a new proposal for the same
issue on every test run, resulting in thousands of duplicates.

Deduplication was implemented on Oct 28, 2025 to track unique issues with
occurrence counts instead of creating duplicate proposals.

## Issues addressed (from archived proposals):
1. ✅ bugfix.core failures - stale (last seen Oct 16)
2. ✅ Tool synthesis validation failures - fixed (name sanitization)
3. ✅ RAG context window - fixed (increased 3K → 12K chars)
4. ✅ Query classification - already fixed
5. ✅ Tool synthesis quota - already fixed
