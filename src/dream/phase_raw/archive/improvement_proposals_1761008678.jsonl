KLoROS was limited to only 2 tools per day and 6 per week, which prevented her from debugging multiple issues or experimenting with different approaches.\n\nEVIDENCE: On Oct 15, 2025, KLoROS attempted to synthesize 17 tools while debugging audio issues and investigating context loss. By the time she tried to create the diagnostic 'context_awareness' tool at 13:04, she had already exhausted her daily quota of 2 tools. Error: \"Promotion blocked: Daily quota exceeded\"\n\nROOT CAUSE: The quota limits were set for production stability but are inappropriate for the active learning/development phase. KLoROS needs room to experiment, create diagnostic tools, and iterate on solutions.\n\nFIX IMPLEMENTED:\n- Increased daily_quota from 2 \u2192 50 tools per day (25x increase)\n- Increased weekly_quota from 6 \u2192 200 tools per week (33x increase)\n- Updated comments to reflect \"active learning/development phase\"\n\nSAFETY MAINTAINED:\n- Risk classification still enforced (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)\n- Shadow testing before promotion still required\n- Quarantine system for risky tools still active\n- Governance policies unchanged\n\nIMPACT: KLoROS can now create up to 50 tools per day, giving her the freedom to:\n- Debug multiple issues simultaneously\n- Create diagnostic tools without quota exhaustion\n- Experiment with different approaches\n- Iterate on tool designs\n- Learn new skills from the 85+ Claude skills installed\n\nThis change is appropriate for the current development phase where rapid experimentation and learning are priorities. Quotas can be reduced later once the system stabilizes.\n\nFILES MODIFIED:\n- /home/kloros/src/tool_synthesis/governance.py:122-123\n"}
