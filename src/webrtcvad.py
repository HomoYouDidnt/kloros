"""A tiny local shim for webrtcvad used in tests to avoid importing pkg_resources.

This provides a minimal Vad class with the same constructor signature used in
the project: webrtcvad.Vad(mode). It implements an is_speech(frame, sample_rate)
method that heuristically treats non-zero frames as speech. This is *not* a
replacement for the real library in production; it only supports unit tests and
local demos where exact VAD behavior is unnecessary.
